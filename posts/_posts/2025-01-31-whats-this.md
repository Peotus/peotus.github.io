Hello and welcome!

This is my first post, and it's also my first time having a blog.

I'm not yet sure what direction this blog will take. I think it will be a place where I share my experiences with my homelab and similar projects. I want to give back by documenting what I've tried and learned along the way—maybe someone will find it useful, maybe not.
Either way, it will help me keep track of what I've accomplished.

If you want to get in touch, whether for suggestions or anything else, you can reach me via the "Mail me" link above or find me on Mastodon at [@peotus@livellosegreto.it](https://livellosegreto.it/@peotus)
I might even join the Pixelfed universe at some point.

For now, that's all.

✨
